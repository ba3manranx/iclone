# Camera_Dolly_Zoom

### Version: 1.0.1

### Introduction

Dolly Zoom is an in-camera effect that utilizes perspective distortion to make the background appear as if itâ€™s changing its size relative to the subject.   The visual appearance for the viewer is that either the background suddenly grows in size and detail to overwhelm the foreground, or the foreground becomes immense and dominates the previous setting, depending on which way the dolly zoom is executed.  This script simulates the Dolly Zoom effect by animating the camera's Focal Length and positioning according to the current camera settings and the desired Focal Length.  Automatic Depth of Field on the target object is an optional setting.
