# Spring Joints

### Version: 1.0.1

Fixed: Tree view not updating when the object hierarchy changes.

### Version: 1.0.0

### Introduction

Spring Joints allows you to apply spring physics to designated bone and prop hierarchies in the scene.  The spring effect is calculated using an algorithm that takes into account several physics elements such as stiffness, bounciness, and damping.  This script is versatile and can turn any existing bone or prop hierarchy into an active physics spring chain.  You can also create a prop chain by attaching various props together and apply spring physics using this plugin.
